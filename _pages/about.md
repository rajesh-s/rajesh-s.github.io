Hello there! My focus is on advancing Computer Systems Architecture, particularly in its application to Machine Learning. At ARM, I work on improving the scalability and efficiency of Computer Systems, with an emphasis on optimizing datacenter infrastructure for emerging workloads.

I earned my graduate degree from [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I worked with [Prof. Matt Sinclair](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sinclair/) at the [Heterogeneous Architectures Lab](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/hal/people.html), on mechanisms to promote data reuse in HPC & ML workloads on chiplet-based GPU architectures.

I've previously worked at [AMD Research](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/research.html), [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com) and [Analog Devices, Inc.](https://www.analog.com/en/product-category/sharc-audio-processors-socs.html) across various layers of abstraction in Computer Architecture. I am well-versed in addressing challenges in parallel computer architecture and optimizing the performance of heterogeneous systems. Some of my prior work includes improving memory coherence, hardware acceleration, and optimizing concurrency in multithreaded and parallel computing environments.
