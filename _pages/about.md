Hi, I’m Rajesh! I’m deeply passionate about research in Computer Architecture and Systems, especially in the context of Machine Learning. At ARM, my work focuses on enhancing the scalability and efficiency of computer systems, with an emphasis on optimizing datacenter infrastructure for emerging workloads.

I earned my graduate degree from [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I worked with Prof. Matthew Sinclair at the [Heterogeneous Architectures Lab](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/hal/people.html), on mechanisms to promote data reuse in HPC & ML workloads on chiplet-based GPU architectures.

I've previously worked at [AMD Research](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/research.html), [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com) and [Analog Devices, Inc.](https://www.analog.com/en/product-category/sharc-audio-processors-socs.html) across various layers of abstraction in Computer Architecture.
