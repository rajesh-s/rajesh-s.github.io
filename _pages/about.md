Hi, I’m Rajesh. I’m passionate about Computer Architecture and optimizing systems for Machine Learning. At [ARM](https://www.arm.com/), I focus on scalability and efficiency of datacenter infrastructure for AI workloads.

With over 7 years of experience in the semiconductor industry, I've held roles at [AMD Research](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/research.html), [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com) and [Analog Devices, Inc.](https://www.analog.com/en/product-category/sharc-audio-processors-socs.html), working across various levels of abstraction in Computer Architecture. I am well-versed in addressing challenges in parallel computer architecture and optimizing the performance of heterogeneous systems.

I earned my graduate degree from [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I worked with [Prof. Matt Sinclair](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sinclair/) at the [Heterogeneous Architectures Lab](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/hal/people.html), on mechanisms to promote data reuse on chiplet-based GPU architectures.
